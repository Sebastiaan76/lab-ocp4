In this lab you will access OpenShift and familiarize yourself with the command line and also the web console. 

View how you are authenticated with OpenShift:

```execute
oc whoami
```

This is your username. 

View the version of both oc - the client - and also the server:

```execute
oc version
```

Note the version of the server. Look for the "Major" and "Minor" numbers, e.g. 4 and 1+.

View the server endpoint through which you are authenticated.

```execute
oc whoami --show-server
```

View which projects (namespaces) you have access to:

```execute
oc projects
```

Fetch the console URL:

```execute
oc whoami --show-console
```

Have a look at the OpenShift Console and view the following:

Your projects can be viewed here:

* [Projects](%console_url%) 

The status of your project can be seen here:

* [Status](%console_url%/overview/ns/%project_namespace%)

OpenShift events can be viewed here:

* [Events](%console_url%/k8s/ns/%project_namespace%/events)

If something is not working properly, this is a good place to look.

Various OpenShift objects can be viewed:

* [Pods](%console_url%/k8s/ns/%project_namespace%/pods) 
* [Builds](%console_url%/k8s/ns/%project_namespace%/buildconfigs)
* [Deployments](%console_url%/k8s/ns/%project_namespace%/deploymentconfigs)
* [Routes](%console_url%/k8s/ns/%project_namespace%/routes) 
* [Workloads](%console_url%/k8s/cluster/projects/%project_namespace%/workloads)

You can view various technologies, including source to image, Templates and Operators here:

* [Developer Catalog](%console_url%/catalog/ns/%project_namespace%)

FIXME: is this useful?:
* [Operator management](%console_url%/operatormanagement/ns/%project_namespace%)

Come back to the terminal tab or click here:

* [Terminal](%terminal_url%)

Open the OpenShift Console in a new tab by using the menu on the op left corner.

FIXME: Guide them to view cluster status, catalog, operator hub, logs, metrics, other great stuff etc etc...
