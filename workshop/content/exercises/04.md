In this lab ... Make a change in the source code and rebuild/redeploy the container... 
Trigger the build, if needed. 

Guide how to make a change in the source code and commit the change.  Using github it's easy.  Follow instructions..... 

You can either make a change using an editor or you can use the below command.

For example, if you want to use an editor, you could use the ``nano`` editor to change the title of the voting definition file:

```execute
nano ~/seeds/seed_data.json
```

... ``OR`` use this command which will substitute some text in the voting definition file:

```execute
sed -i "s/Favourite Linux distribution/Your favourite Linux distribution/" ~/seeds/seed_data.json
```

You have just made a change to the source code. After building and 'testing' the application on your local workstation and are happy that it works, 
you now need to ``commit`` and ``push`` that change to GitHub. 

Check the changes you made with git:

```execute
git status
```

Commit the changes:

```execute
git commit "Changed voting data" . 
```

Push the changes to GitHub:

```execute
git push 
```


If you had set up the GitHub webhook in the precvious lab, you should see the build starting automatically.  You will see a build pod running in the lower terminal.

If you did not set up a webhook, trigger a new build manually:

```execute
oc start-build vote-app 
```

You can follow the build progress:

```execute
oc logs bv/vote-app --follow
```

You should see the python application building again, a new image being commited and pushed into the internal registry. The application should be re-deployed.

Once the new pod is up and runing, check the change is now deployed:

```execute 
curl http://vote-app-%project_namespace%.%cluster_subdomain%/ 
```

Test the application in a browser with the following URL:

[Open the Vote Application](http://vote-app-%project_namespace%.%cluster_subdomain%/)


Yopu how know how to make changes to your code and test the results.  Next you will ... FIXME...
