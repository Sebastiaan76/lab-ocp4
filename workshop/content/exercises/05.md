 - _FIXME: Note, for this lab, could use a DB operator, although I can't find one that is suitable as they need so much work still._

In this lab you will launch a database and configure your application to use the database instead of the build-in database.

Launch a database and connect the application to it:

Run this to start a MySQL container:

```execute
oc new-app --name db mysql:5.7 \
   -e MYSQL_USER=user \
   -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password \
   -e MYSQL_DATABASE=vote 
```

MySQL will be started and configured as shown in the command arguments. 

Take a look at the log output:

```execute
oc logs dc/db
```

Wait for the database to be running.  You will see ``ready for connections`` in the log output. 

At this point in time, the application has no idea about the existence of the MySQL database. You need to re-configure the application to use the new database. 
To do that we need to change the vote application's environment variables and re-launch the pod. 

Connect the application to the database:

```execute
oc set env dc vote-app \
   DB_HOST=db \
   DB_PORT=3306 \
   DB_NAME=vote \
   DB_USER=user \
   DB_PASS=password \
   DB_TYPE=mysql
```

The above command sets the environment variables as stated in the arguments. The deployment configuration restarts the pod because of the configuration change.

In this lab you have launched a database and connected the application to it.  
Now, the application is no longer  dependent on the built-in database and can freely scale out if needed. 

In the next lab ... FIXME
