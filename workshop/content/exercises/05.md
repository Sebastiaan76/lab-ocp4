_Note, for this lab, could use a DB operator, although I can't find one that works, yet._

In this lab ... you will launch a database and configure your application to use the database..... 

Launch a database and connect the application to it...

Run this to start MySQL container:

```execute
oc new-app --name db -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=vote mysql:5.7
```

Connect the application to the database....

Explain what will happen... 

```execute
oc set env dc vote-app DB_HOST=db DB_PORT=3306 DB_NAME=vote DB_USER=user DB_PASS=password DB_TYPE=mysql
```

Explain how that worked...
