Is this lab you will fetch the source code that you will use for the rest of the labs.  

You will make a copy (fork) of the source code repository in GitHub and then, using the source code, build deploy it to OpenShift. 

## Fork the repository 

First, set up a source code repository in your own GitHub account.  You will need your GitHub username and password for
the next step.  If you don't have an account, first sign up for one
at [http://github.com/](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) and remember the username and password.

 - ``Note: Github is a site based on an open source version control system known as git, like other version control software git helps with tracking changes to a repository of files. 

Ensure you are in the top level home directory:

```execute 
cd ~/ 
```

The next step will fork the GitHub repository ``flask-vote-app`` into your GitHub account.  The flask-vote-app repository 
contains a voting application based on the Python web application framework called Flask. 

Run the next command and enter your GitHub username and password when prompted:

```execute 
fork-repo sjbylo/flask-vote-app
```

You should now have your own GitHub repository containing the example source code. 

```execute
ls -ld flask-vote-app 
```

Change into the new repository directory:

```execute
cd flask-vote-app
```

Run this command to verify the new repository belongs to you.  

```execute
git remote -v
```

You should see your GitHub username in the output. For example:

```
...github.com/johnsmith/...
```

Now you have fetched the source code, the next lab will get that code running on OpenShift.
