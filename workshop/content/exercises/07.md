Note: For this lab the "aws operator" must be installed first by a cluster admin user. 

In this lab you will provision a XXX in AWS and then configure your application to use it.... 

Using the AWS Operator, provision an aws service (e.g. SQS or dynamo DB).  Connect the aws service to the application and test it. 

Hope to use the same app as above, or use a separate app.
