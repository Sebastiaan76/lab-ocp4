# Labs

## Preparation 

We will set up a full 4.1 cluster for this lab. 

Looking into using one of the following methods to run the workshop:
1. Ask participants to log into a linux ec2 instance where we can set up all tools needed, e.g. oc, git etc
1. Use this new workshop tool by Graham D... which looks to become very papular, also with the BU.  https://github.com/openshift-labs/workshop-dashboard/
1. Use the older "workshopper" CMS.  For this, need to install oc on laptop, so not preferred.
