The Homeroom project aims to provide a set of applications useful in hosting training workshops. These can be supervised workshops run in a classroom like environment, or can be self paced workshops provided via an online interactive learning portal.

In this workshop you will learn how to create the initial content for a workshop, and how to deploy it so you can update and test it.
